# Distributed Key Management Service: 
VetKeys can be used to faciliate a distributed key management service (DKMS)

Since vetKeys are only known to the client that requested them: the client can use it for encryption, signing and further key derivation - derived keys can be shared with other users, by adding corresponding user permissions to the canister. 

## ``KeyManager`` Library: 
Offers Access Control and VetKey derivation
