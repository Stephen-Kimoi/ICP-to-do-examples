# Tamper-Proof Post Likes: Web2 API + ICP Integration Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to integrate your existing Web2 API with the Internet Computer (ICP) to create tamper-proof, decentralized functionality. We'll build a simple likes counter system where your Web2 backend handles the API logic, but the actual like counts are stored immutably on ICP.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **Web2 + ICP Integration**: How to bridge traditional web APIs with blockchain functionality
- **ICP Agents**: Using the JavaScript agent to call canisters from Node.js
- **Tamper-Proof Data**: Why decentralization matters for data integrity
- **Local Development**: Setting up and testing ICP integration locally

## 🛠️ What We're Building

### 1. **ICP Canister (Rust)**
- Stores like counts for different posts
- `like(post_id)` - Increments likes (update call)
- `get_likes(post_id)` - Retrieves likes (query call)
- Tamper-proof and decentralized storage

### 2. **Web2 API (Node.js + Express)**
- `GET /likes/:postId` - Get likes for a post
- `POST /like/:postId` - Like a post
- `GET /posts` - Get all posts with like counts
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

### 3. **Integration Layer**
- DFINITY JavaScript agent for canister communication
- Server-side identity management
- Error handling and response processing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [DFINITY SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/) installed
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Basic knowledge of Rust and Node.js

### Step 1: Clone and Setup
```bash
# Navigate to the project
cd post-likes-tutorial

# Install Web2 API dependencies
cd web2-api
npm install

# Install additional test dependency
npm install node-fetch
```

### Step 2: Start Local ICP Network
```bash
# From the project root
dfx start --background
```

### Step 3: Deploy the Canister
```bash
# Deploy the Rust canister
dfx deploy post-likes-backend

# Generate the JavaScript bindings
dfx generate post-likes-backend
```

### Step 4: Start the Web2 API
```bash
# From the web2-api directory
npm start
```

### Step 5: Test the Integration
```bash
# In a new terminal, run the test client
node test-client.js
```

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Health Check
```bash
GET /health
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Web2 API is running and connected to ICP"
}
```

### Get Likes for a Post
```bash
GET /likes/{postId}
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "postId": "post-1",
  "likes": "5",
  "message": "Likes retrieved from ICP canister"
}
```

### Like a Post
```bash
POST /like/{postId}
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "postId": "post-1",
  "newLikes": "6",
  "message": "Post liked successfully on ICP canister"
}
```

### Get All Posts with Likes
```bash
GET /posts
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": "post-1",
      "title": "Getting Started with ICP",
      "content": "Learn the basics...",
      "likes": "6"
    }
  ],
  "message": "Posts retrieved with ICP-stored like counts"
}
```

## 🔑 Key Concepts Explained

### **Why ICP for Likes?**
- **Tamper-Proof**: Once stored, likes cannot be manipulated by backend administrators
- **Decentralized**: Data is stored across multiple nodes, not controlled by a single entity
- **Verifiable**: Anyone can verify the authenticity of like counts
- **Cost-Effective**: ICP storage is significantly cheaper than traditional cloud storage

### **How the Agent Works**
1. **Identity Management**: Creates cryptographic identity for server-side calls
2. **Request Encoding**: Converts JavaScript calls to Candid format
3. **Network Communication**: Handles HTTP requests to ICP network
4. **Response Processing**: Decodes and verifies canister responses

### **Query vs Update Calls**
- **Query Calls** (`get_likes`): Fast, read-only, no state changes
- **Update Calls** (`like`): Slower, modifies state, requires consensus

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

The `test-client.js` demonstrates the complete flow:

1. **Health Check**: Verify API is running
2. **Initial State**: Check starting like counts
3. **Like Operations**: Test incrementing likes
4. **Verification**: Confirm changes are persisted
5. **Multiple Posts**: Test different post IDs
6. **Bulk Operations**: Retrieve all posts with likes

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `web2-api` directory:
```env
PORT=3000
DFX_NETWORK=local
POST_LIKES_BACKEND_CANISTER_ID=your_canister_id_here
```

### Canister ID
The canister ID is automatically detected from your local deployment, but you can override it with the environment variable.

## 🚨 Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Invalid Post IDs**: Empty or malformed post identifiers
- **Network Issues**: ICP network connectivity problems
- **Canister Errors**: Runtime errors in the Rust canister
- **API Validation**: Input validation and sanitization

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Identity Management**: Server-side identity for canister calls
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs
- **Error Messages**: Don't expose internal system details
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for production

## 🚀 Next Steps

After completing this tutorial, you can:

1. **Add Authentication**: Implement user authentication for like operations
2. **Extend Data Model**: Add more fields to posts and likes
3. **Implement Caching**: Cache frequently accessed like counts
4. **Add Monitoring**: Track API performance and canister calls
5. **Deploy to Mainnet**: Move from local development to production
