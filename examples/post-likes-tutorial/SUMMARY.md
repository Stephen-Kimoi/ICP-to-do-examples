### **2. Complete Integration Architecture**
```
Web2 API (Node.js) ←→ ICP Agent ←→ ICP Canister (Rust)
     ↓                    ↓              ↓
HTTP Endpoints    Authentication   Immutable Storage
Business Logic    CBOR Encoding    Decentralized
Error Handling    Network Calls    Tamper-Proof
```
